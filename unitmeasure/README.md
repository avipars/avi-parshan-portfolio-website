# unitMeasure Landing Page
This website is a landing page for my android app, unitMeasure, check out the website for more details. http://aviparshan.com/unitmeasure/
It is based off a template called New Age. The reason why I did this was to get the page up quicker and have a good starting design. If I built a site from scratch, it would have taken twice as long. I am not a javascript or web developer by training (besides some XHTML and CSS Course that I took in high-school), I'd rather spend my time adding value to the android app or at least work on soemthing that I am more proficient and productive. 

I minified some code, played around with gulp a bit, and made the site faster and less resource intensive. 

First, I got rid of Font-Awesome and the other Simple-Line-Icon Font. There are hundreds of items that I won't ever need to host for my website, so why waste space?
When I said "got rid of", I meant shrunk down the font library and selected the few icons that I actually needed. 
This site is how I achieved that: https://icomoon.io/app/#/select

I also changed over to Marvel Screenshots for the Phone Frames because it had a different design that didn't make my website look outdated. It aslo saves a lot of CSS and unused code. Just add the minified css to your project and replace the old phone frames.

This project helped me learn about how gulp, sass(scss),npm, and also visual studio code functions in unison. (I am used to dreamweaver and android studio for the most part). I was able to optimize images through an npm module and also change CTA banners randomly, everytime I run a build task with Gulp. 

Thanks to the amazing photographers on Unspash for allowing me to use your images. Thanks to Google Material Design and Material Design Icons too for providing the svg files (https://materialdesignicons.com/), in addition to the other sources I mentioned earlier and especially StartBootstap.com for offering amazing free templates for websites! I apologize if I forgot to mention anyone specifically.
