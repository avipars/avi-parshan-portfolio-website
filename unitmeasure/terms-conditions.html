        <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
        <hr>
        <br>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>By downloading or using the app, these terms will automatically apply to you – you should make sure
          therefore that you read them carefully before using the app. You’re not allowed to copy, or modify
          the
          app, any part of the app, or our trademarks in any way. You’re not allowed to attempt to extract the
          source code of the app, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the app into other languages, or
          make
          derivative versions. The app itself, and all the trade marks, copyright, database rights and other
          intellectual
          property rights related to it, still belong to Avi Parshan.</p>
        <p>Avi Parshan is committed to ensuring that the app is as useful and efficient as possible. For
          that reason, we reserve the right to make changes to the app or to charge for its services, at any
          time
          and for any reason. We will never charge you for the app or its services without making it very
          clear
          to you exactly what you’re paying for.</p>
        <p>The unitMeasure app does not stores or process personal data. It’s your responsibility to keep your
          phone and access to the app secure. We therefore
          recommend that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software
          restrictions
          and limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone
          vulnerable
          to malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean
          that
          the unitMeasure app won’t work properly or at all. </p>
        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that Avi Parshan will not take responsibility
          for. Certain functions of the app, at some point, require the app to have an active internet
          connection. The connection
          can be Wi-Fi, or provided by your mobile network provider, but Avi Parshan cannot take
          responsibility
          for the app not working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have
          any
          of your data allowance left.
        </p>
        <p></p>
        <p>If you’re using the app outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that your terms of the
          agreement with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by
          your mobile provider for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the
          app, or other third party charges. In using the app, you’re accepting responsibility for any such
          charges, including roaming data charges if you use the app outside of your home territory (i.e.
          region
          or country) without turning off data roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which
          you’re using the app, please be aware that we assume that you have received permission from the bill
          payer for using the app.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, Avi Parshan cannot always take responsibility for the way you use
          the app i.e. You need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and
          you can’t turn it on to avail the Service, Avi Parshan cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>With respect to Avi Parshan’s responsibility for your use of the app, when you’re using
          the app, it’s important to bear in mind that although we endeavour to ensure that it is updated and
          correct at all times, we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make
          it available to you. Avi Parshan accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect,
          you experience as a result of relying wholly on this functionality of the app.</p>
        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the app. The app is currently available on Android – the
          requirements for system (and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability
          of the app to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the
          app. Avi Parshan does not promise that it will always update the app so that it is relevant
          to you and/or works with the Android version that you have installed on your device. However,
          you promise to always accept updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to
          stop providing the app, and may terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination
          to you. Unless we tell you otherwise, upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to
          you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop using the app, and (if needed) delete it from your
          device.
        <p><strong>Changes to This Terms and Conditions</strong></p>
        <p> I may update our Terms and Conditions from time to time. Thus, you are advised
          to review this page periodically for any changes. I will notify you of any
          changes by posting the new Terms and Conditions on this page. These changes are effective
          immediately
          after they are posted on this page.
